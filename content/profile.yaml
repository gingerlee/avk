  about: |
    I work full-time at Atlassian as a Marketing Data Analyst (contractor) on the Audience Targeting and Optimization (ATO) team, and am seeking a full-time position, ideally staying at Atlassian. Outside of work, I am pursuing my master's degree in Data Analytics, class of 2022 at Oregon State University. In my day-to-day work at Atlassian, I enjoy building complex targeted audience selections using SQL to drive growth using customer lifecycle marketing.

    I value research, exploration, integrity, and kindness. I have been working in the data science industry for the past 13 years, bringing clarity and insights through data analysis, data quality, and forecasting â€” driving informed and conscientious decision-making.

    Offline you can find me enjoying trail running with my dog Xanne, mountian biking, and spending time with my family in beautiful Sisters, Oregon.
