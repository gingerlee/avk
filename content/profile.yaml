  about: |
    I value research, exploration, integrity, and kindness. I have been working in the data science industry for the past 13 years, bringing clarity and insights through data analysis, data quality, and forecasting â€” driving informed and conscientious decision-making.

    I am currently working full-time at Atlassian on the Audience Targeting and Optimization (ATO) team, as well as pursuing my master's degree in Data Analytics, class of 2022 at Oregon State University. In my day-to-day at Atlassian, I enjoy building complex targeted audience selections using SQL to drive growth using customer lifecycle marketing.

    Outside of work you can find me enjoying trail running with my dog Xanne, and spending time with my family in central Oregon.
