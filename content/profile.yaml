  about: |
    I value integrity, research, exploration, and kindness. I have been working in the data science industry for the past 13 years, bringing clarity and insights through data analysis, data quality and forecasting — driving informed and conscientious decision-making.

    I am currently pursuing my masters in Data Analytics, class of 2022 at Oregon State University — I am inspired by learning, problem-solving, and helping those around me.

    Outside of work you can find me enjoying trail running with my dog Xanne, and spending time with my family in central Oregon.
