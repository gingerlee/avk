  about: |
    I work full-time at Atlassian as a Senior Data Analyst on the Audience Targeting and Optimization (ATO) team. Alongside work, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Data Analytics, class of 2023 from Oregon State University.

    I have been working in the data science industry for the past 14+ years, bringing clarity and insights to support informed and conscientious decision-making. In my day-to-day work at Atlassian, I see this through by building complex targeted audience selections using SQL, R and Python to help drive revenue growth. I value curiosity, exploration, integrity, and kindness, and am grateful to find these core values reflected back during my time working at Atlassian.

    Offline you can find me enjoying trail running with my dog Xanne, mountain biking, and spending time with my family in beautiful Sisters, Oregon.
