  about: |
    I work full-time at Atlassian as a Marketing Data Analyst (contractor) on the Audience Targeting and Optimization (ATO) team, and am seeking a full-time in-house position, ideally at Atlassian. Outside of work, I am pursuing my master's degree in Data Analytics, class of 2022 at Oregon State University.

    I value research, exploration, integrity, and kindness. I have been working in the data science industry for the past 13 years, bringing clarity and insights through data analysis, data quality, and forecasting â€” driving informed and conscientious decision-making. In my day-to-day work at Atlassian, I see this through by building complex targeted audience selections using SQL to drive growth for the company.

    Offline you can find me enjoying trail running with my dog Xanne, mountian biking, and spending time with my family in beautiful Sisters, Oregon.
